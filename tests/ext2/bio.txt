Research

My research is about the design, semantics and implementation of programming languages with strong safety properties for implementing critical control software (e.g., fly-by-wire in civil planes). I have particular interest for synchronous languages, their extensions and embedding into general-purpose functional languages. With Paul Caspi and Grégoire Hamon, I developed the language Lucid Synchrone, an extension a la ML of Lustre. Several features and compilation techniques have been integrated to SCADE 6 at Esterel-Technologies. In collaboration with INRIA (Alchemy) and NXP, I worked on the N-synchronous model to program real-time video systems (e.g., TV boxes). Currently, my research is about the semantics and implementation of hybrid systems modelers (e.g., Simulink, Modelica), the design and implementation of Zélus, a synchronous language that mixes discrete and continuous time, and the formal certification of a Lustre compiler with Coq. See publications and talks.

In Nov. 2016, I received the Inria – French Académie des sciences – Dassault Systèmes Innovation Award.
